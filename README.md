# Bogusz_et_al_2024_PopStudies

This repository contains codes used to create the analysis for the paper:
Bogusz, H., Matysiak, A., & Kreyenfeld, M. (2024). Structural Labour Market Change, Cognitive Work, and Fertility in Germany. *Population Studies*, forthcoming. https://doi.org/10.1080/00324728.2024.2365111

It contains the following folders: 

codes;\
final_data;\
generated_data;\
original_data;\
plots;\
tables.

The folder 'codes' contains eight Stata/R files. They should be run from 1 to 8 to generate all plots (folder 'plots') and tables (folder 'tables') displayed in the paper.

The folder 'original_data' contains two folders with the original BiBB Employment Survey and German Socioeconomic Panel (GSOEP, release 37). Those folders are named 'BIBB-Erwerbstaetige_1-7' and 'SOEP-CORE.v37eu_STATA', respectively. 

The folder 'generated_data' contains intermediate data files, while the folder 'final_data' contains two generated data files used for the analysis.

Please mind **README** files in the 'final_data', 'generated_data', and 'original_data' folders.
